Jupyter notebooks->
creation_of_inverted_index contains the code how intial inverted index is created

We now split the inverted index to multiple chunks so that queries could be answered without loading everything on RAM
Now dictionary_creater is used to remember the chunk in which a particular word could be found

finally query engine is used to implement the Tf-idf model and give the results.

creation_of_inverted_index generates a file similar to sample_of_inverted_index
dictionary creater generates a file similar to word_location_dictionary.

Note that these were not the final codes but unfortunately my internal HDD failed and the system on which these codes were run was 
given only for the purpose of term project and hence I dont have access to the final codes.
